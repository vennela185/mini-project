        "The objective of this program is to create a Python application that collects marks of multiple students, stores them using a NumPy array, and performs basic calculations such as total, average, highest, and lowest marks. Based on the average marks, the program assigns a grade using conditional statements. The program uses basic Python concepts like functions, loops, lists, and NumPy operations.\n"

        "The program begins by defining a user-defined function in which all operations are performed. An empty list is first created to store the marks of students. Using a for loop, the program takes marks as input from the user and stores them in the list. This list is then converted into a NumPy array to perform mathematical operations easily. The total and average marks are calculated using NumPy functions. Based on the calculated average, conditional statements are used to assign a grade to the students. Finally, the calculated results and grade are displayed using print statements."
